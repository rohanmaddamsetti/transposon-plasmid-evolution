specificity-analysis.jl by Rohan Maddamsetti.

I use Fisher's exact test to test genes for the clustering of occurrences of mutations
in that gene within treatments.

I also use a randomization test to test for similarity of metagenomic evolution within
treatments (similar to analyses that use Dice coefficient as a similarity metric),

and use a randomization test to compare the similarity of metagenomic evolution
to external genomic datasets from evolution experiments with Tetracycline selection.

## comparison of evolutionary paths to other published evolution experiments.

## Bottery 2017 in Nature Ecology and Evolution.
## from the Results:
## Thirty independent isogenic populations of E. coli MG1655 carrying the MDR
## plasmid RK214, which encodes resistances to TET and AMP, were experimentally
## evolved for ~530 generations (80 days), under five antibiotic treatments
## (six independently evolving lines per treatment):
## no antibiotic (N); AMP (A); TET (T); AMP plus TET (AT); and 24 h cycling
## between AMP and TET (A/T) (see Methods). Six control populations of plasmid-free
## MG1655 were similarly experimentally evolved with no antibiotic (C).
## Plasmids remained at high frequency in all populations for the duration of the
## selection experiment. Plasmid-free segregants were observed only at very low
## frequency in two of the six populations from treatment N (Supplementary Fig. 1),
## whereas transposition of resistance genes from RK2 onto the hostโs chromosome was
## never observed.

## the 380012 +G frmR/yaiO K-12 MG1655 mutation 
## 286010, -131/+56 frmR/yaiO in DH5-alpha are homologous!
## They affect the same G(9) or G(10) repeat.
## NOTA BENE: this mutation was seen in 1/6 Tet lines, and 1/6 no plasmid no antibiotic
## lines in the Bottery dataset. Another mutation at 379915, or at the -34 position
## relative to frmR was observed in 1/6 of the +plasmid -antibiotic treatement in
## Bottery et al. (2017).

## phase variation in the same G(8) repeat is in the LTEE Genomes (see Shiny app).
## only in populations Ara-2, Ara-4, Ara+3, Ara-3. However, these mutations
## occur in the hypermutator LTEE populations (but not Ara-1 nor Ara+6).

## This paper reports that frmR represses conjugation of IncP1-alpha plasmids:
## Isolation and Analysis of Donor Chromosomal Genes Whose Deficiency Is Responsible
## for Accelerating Bacterial and Trans-Kingdom Conjugations by IncP1 T4SS Machinery
## the frm operon is induced in response to formaldehyde

## idea for how to do this analysis, from Deatherage et al. (2014):
## We measured the similarity of genomic evolution in the TEE to the LTEE by calculating
## a recapitulation index (RI) equal to the percentage of qualifying mutations in a
## particular thermal group that affected genes that subsequently acquired a qualifying
## mutation in an LTEE clone from the source population. For example, 10 of the 22
## qualifying mutations in the 37 ยฐC TEE group are found in hslU (five lines), ybaL (two
## lines), iclR, insJ-5, and mrdA, and all five of these genes also harbor qualifying
## mutations in the 20K clone in the LTEE population from which the progenitor was
## sampled. The 20K RI is therefore 45% (10/22) for the set of TEE lines that
## evolved at 37 ยฐC.
