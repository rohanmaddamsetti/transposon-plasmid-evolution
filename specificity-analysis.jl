specificity-analysis.jl by Rohan Maddamsetti.

I use Fisher's exact test to test genes for the clustering of occurrences of mutations
in that gene within treatments.

I also use a randomization test to test for similarity of metagenomic evolution within
treatments (similar to analyses that use Dice coefficient as a similarity metric),

and use a randomization test to compare the similarity of metagenomic evolution
to external genomic datasets from evolution experiments with Tetracycline selection.

This analysis builds upon the analysis framework in:
Deatherage et al. (2017) "Specificity of genome evolution in experimental populations of
Escherichia coli evolved at different temperatures"

TODO: correct p-values for multiple testing as needed in the future.

## Thirty independent isogenic populations of E. coli MG1655 carrying the MDR
## plasmid RK214, which encodes resistances to TET and AMP, were experimentally
## evolved for ~530 generations (80 days), under five antibiotic treatments
## (six independently evolving lines per treatment):
## no antibiotic (N); AMP (A); TET (T); AMP plus TET (AT); and 24 h cycling
## between AMP and TET (A/T) (see Methods). Six control populations of plasmid-free
## MG1655 were similarly experimentally evolved with no antibiotic (C).
## Plasmids remained at high frequency in all populations for the duration of the
## selection experiment. Plasmid-free segregants were observed only at very low
## frequency in two of the six populations from treatment N (Supplementary Fig. 1),

## idea for how to do this analysis, from Deatherage et al. (2017):
## We measured the similarity of genomic evolution in the TEE to the LTEE by calculating
## a recapitulation index (RI) equal to the percentage of qualifying mutations in a
## particular thermal group that affected genes that subsequently acquired a qualifying
## mutation in an LTEE clone from the source population. For example, 10 of the 22
## qualifying mutations in the 37 ยฐC TEE group are found in hslU (five lines), ybaL (two
## lines), iclR, insJ-5, and mrdA, and all five of these genes also harbor qualifying
## mutations in the 20K clone in the LTEE population from which the progenitor was
## sampled. The 20K RI is therefore 45% (10/22) for the set of TEE lines that
## evolved at 37 ยฐC.
